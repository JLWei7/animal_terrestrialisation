# Principal component analysis

We performed the principal component analysis to GO terms of novel genes and ancestral genes among all 151 metazoans. Please find the R script in **04_principal_component_analysis/scripts/pca_novel_goterms.R**, and the input file **novel_goterms_terrestrialspecies_df.csv**

This is the script example of GO terms of novel genes, we also generated PCA diagrams for GO terms of novel genes without Bdelloidea, GO terms of ancestral genes, GO terms of ancestral genes without tetrapods. Please see all DataFrames in **04_principal_component_analysis**
