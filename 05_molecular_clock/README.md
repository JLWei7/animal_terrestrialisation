# Molecular Clock

We performed molcular clock to estimate the species divergence time using [MCMCtree v4.10.7](https://github.com/sabifo4/Tutorial_MCMCtree). 

For testing convergence, we run 6 chains, the results are uploaded in **05_molecular_clock/6_chains**. The convrgence is tested in [Tracer](https://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/), the paramters are shown in **05_molecular_clock/tracer_comparison.xlsx**.
